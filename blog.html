        <article>

         <p class="sub-title">1. % (Percentage) </p>
        <p class="content">
          The percentage CSS data type represents a percentage value. It is often used to define a size as
          relative to an element's parent object. Numerous properties can use percentages  , such as width, height, 
          margin, padding, and font-size.The percentage data type consists of a number followed by the percentage 
          sign (%). Optionally, it may be preceded by a single  + or  - sign, although negative values are not valid for 
          all properties. As with all CSS dimensions, there is no space between the symbol and the number.</p>
          <p class="content">
          The following will set the width of the .child element to be 70% of the width of its parent. 
          The element’s line height will be set to 140% of the value of its own font size. <br><br>
        
          .child { <br>
              width: 70%; /* relative to the width of its container */ <br>
              font-size: 16px; <br>
              line-height: 140%; /* relative to its font size */ <br>
          }
          <br><br></p>
          <p class="sub-title" >
          2. em 
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          In CSS, an em unit is equal to the computed font-size for the element to which the em is applied.
          When em units are declared on child elements that don’t have a font-size defined, they will inherit 
          their font-size from their parent, or from another ancestor element, possibly going all the way back to 
          the root element on the document. <br>
          Look at the following CSS:</p>
          <p class="content">
          .example { <br>
              font-size: 20px; <br>
          } <br>
          In this case, 1em on this element, or on its child elements (assuming no other font-size definitions), 
          would be equal to 20px. So if we added a line:
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          .example { <br>
              font-size: 20px; <br>
              border-radius: .5em; <br>
          }
          This border-radius value of .5em computes to 10px (i.e. 20*.5). Similarly: 
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          .example { <br>
              font-size: 20px; <br>
              border-radius: .5em; <br>
              padding: 2em; <br>
          }
          The padding value of 2em is equal to 40px (20*2). 
        </p>
        <p class="sub-title">
          3. rem 
        
        <p class="content">
          The rem unit in CSS always inherits its value from the base font size setting on the root element of the document, 
          irrespective of the computed font size. In HTML, the root  element is always the html element. So you could use rems,
          but this would mean you’ll have to control all components on the page using the font size on that element. 
          It<br> could work on certain projects, but I think this technique works best when focusing the resizability on an 
          isolated component, rather than the whole document.
          <p class="content">
           One rem unit is: <br>
          Equal to the computed value of font-size on the root element. When specified on the font-size property of the root 
          element, the rem units refer to the property’s initial value.</p>
          <p class="content">
          so based on the above description and in my opinion it doesn't matter to use either %, em or rem but It is obvious 
          that there are many advantages in using rem in our code, like  responsiveness, scalability, improved reading experience, 
          and greater flexibility in defining components.

        <p class="title" id="Q5">Question 5: Answer </p>
        <article>
            <p>Setting the font size in pixel values (px) is a good choice when you need pixel accuracy which is static.
              Needless to say, the default browser  font-size is 16px. For the browser 16px is equal to 100% and
              everything is scaled compared to 16px. For example, if the font size of a paragraph
              is 200px, the browser will calculate it like: if 16px is 100%, 200px is what?
              So it will understand it as 200px is 1250 times default browser size(16px).
              like 32px is twice of the default value. But, the browser passes a lot of steps to understand
              this. Let's look at it.
              When you write some HTML, CSS, and JS, and attempt to open the HTML file in your browser, 
              the browser reads the <strong>raw bytes</strong> of HTML from your hard disk (or network).But not the 
              actual characters you have written.
              The browser receives the bytes of data, but it can’t really do anything with it; the raw bytes of 
              data must be converted to a form it understands. So, the raw bytes will be converted into <strong>characters</strong>
              and these characters are further parsed into something called <strong>tokens</strong>. Thus, the HTML file will be
              broken down to tokens and this is how the browser begins to understand what we have written. Then,
              the tokens will be converted into <strong>nodes</strong>. Upon creating these nodes, the nodes are then linked in a 
              tree data structure known as the <strong>Document Object Model(DOM)</strong>. But, we didn't still come to CSS and measurements.
              But, While the browser receives the raw bytes of data and kicks off the DOM construction process, it will also 
              make a request to fetch the .css stylesheet linked.As soon the browser begins to parse the HTML, upon finding a 
              link tag to a CSS file, it simultaneously makes a request to fetch that. Here after, the same procedure 
              like the HTML will be applied. Raw bytes-characters-tokens-nodes-tree formed and the bytes-characters-tokens-nodes-tree
              created is called <strong>CSSOM(CSS Object Model)</strong>. Now,the browser combines the DOM and CSSOM trees into something 
              called a render tree. With the render tree constructed, the next step is to perform the layout. Right now, 
              we have the content and style information of all visible content on the screen, but we haven’t actually 
              rendered anything to the screen. Here it comes the calculation that we have talked earlier. The browser
              has to calculate the exact size and position of each object on the page. Then, the browser will begin to 
              calculate relative to the default browser size.With the information about the exact positions of each element now computed, 
              all that is left is to paint the elements to the screen.</p>

        <p class="title" id="Q6">Question 6: Answer</p>
        <article>
            <p>CSS3 is the latest version of CSS. It provides JavaScript like capabilities. In addition to this, it also 
              provides mobile development features. It also has additional features like images, gradient, transition, etc.
            </p>
              <p class="sub-title">1.compatablity</p>
              
              <p>CSS3 is ackward compatible with CSS1. It will not make any code written in CSS1 invalid. It makes the look and 
                feel of a webpage even better. They load faster and the time required to build a page is even less.</p>
              
              <p  class="sub-title">2. Rounded corners and Gradients</p>
              
             <p> Before CSS3 was launched developers used to design images which loooked like rounded corners to different strucures
              and background gradients. But in CSS3 developres  just need to write the code like </p>
              
              <p>.round-border{ <br>
                border-radius: 10px; <br>
             } <br>
             .groundBG{ <br>
               liner-gradient(white,black); <br>
             }</p>
              
              <p  class="sub-title">3.Animation and Text Effects</p>
              
              <p>Animation in CSS were written in javascript and JQuery. But Using CSS3 a developer can add text and shadow to make it easier
                to read. They can also add visual  effects to break lines and longer words so that they fit properly inside the cloumns and word wraps</p>
              
              <p  class="sub-title">4. Lists</p>
              
              <p>CSS3 doesn't support numbering system and hence might ignore it being used. It enables that an image is set against againest the
                list item maker.</p>
              
              <p class="sub-title">5. Pseduo Classes</p>
              <p>
              Their are some additional features that make it easier and famous to use.
              These include:
               <ol>
                <li>Root target which document's root element </li>
                <li>nth-children(n) uses numeric values within (n) to target child elements with respect to their postion in the parent.</li>
                <li>empty taregets elements that do not have text or children, like empty elements such as </li>
               </ol>
              </p>
